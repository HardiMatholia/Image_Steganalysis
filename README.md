# Image Steganalysis: In Search for the Invisible
## Introduction 
This repository provides the source code and raw datasets associated with the study of Image Steganalysis.

As digital communication and multimedia technologies evolve, ensuring the security of information becomes increasingly critical. Images often transmitted online are vulnerable to unauthorized modifications and security threats. One such threat is steganography, a technique used to hide secret information within digital images in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye. While it can be used for secure communication, it can also be exploited for malicious purposes, such as hiding illegal content or spreading harmful information.

Steganalysis is the process of detecting hidden messages in digital images that have been concealed using steganography. It involves analyzing images for suspicious patterns or features to uncover concealed information and mitigate the risks posed by the malicious use of steganography.
